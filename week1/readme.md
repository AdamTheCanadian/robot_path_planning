# Week 1
These scripts contain the implementation of solving grid based path planning problems using graph based algorithms.
Following along Courseras Robot Specialization: Computational Path Planning.

These are not the actual problems presented in the course, my own version of the problems.

*I am not going for code style points, production level implementations, or for super efficient implementations*
